# tprandomizer-poc-gui

The purpose of this project is to continue the progress made on the randomizer backend here: https://github.com/lunarsoap5/tprandomizer-poc/ while also implementing a basic interface to allow for real-time implementation.

# Goals of this project:
- Set a standard for the components of the gui
- Create a stand-alone randomizer program that works seperate from the gui, allowing for a universal compatibility, assuming that the proper output is given by the generator
